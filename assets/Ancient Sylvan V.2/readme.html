<h2>Description</h2>
<p>So, her eis another ancient unit. This one is big bad m****** sylvan/ent. I wanted to make some giant siege unit/protector of the forest. Has even alternate stand, something like sleeping position, so you can I dont know...maybe make some pretty ancient groove with sleeping ents, who can be awaken by their queen, or whatever. Hope you like it. See you soon at the next model.<br />
