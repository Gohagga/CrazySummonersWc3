<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Decided to make another icon based on a Pokémon attack. This time it&#039;s Hydro Pump!<br />
<br />
Credit me if you use it in a map.<br />
Don&#039;t edit my icons without my permission.<br />
Feedback is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Updates:<br />
<br />
Darkened the background<br />
Added more shadows and painted some darker blue on the edges to define it a bit.<br />
Removed some white glowing stripes to center the attention and define the water stream.<br />
<br />
